- MSW: Fixed an issue with the converter for configurations from FileZilla Server 0.9.x

1.4.0 (2022-04-29)

- Admin UI: changed wording in the logging settings
- Admin UI: made default connection values correct, in case the settings file is missing.
- MSW: fixed various bug in the ExecDos plugin, that could cause the admin password not to be set properly.

- MSW: fixed a bug in libfilezilla that caused an unexpected failure when creating directories with restricted access. It had effects on the ACME account creation. 

1.4.0-rc1 (2022-04-20)

! MSW: the installer doesn't rely on the PATH environment variable to find the tools it needs, but refers to them absolutely, to avoid hijacking.
+ The size of the TCP buffer sizes on the sockets used for data transfers can now be specified
+ Configuration files are now tagged with a "flavour" and a version number. The Server will refuse to load configuration files with a different flavour than its own or with a version higher than its own. The server's option --config-version-check can be used to control this functionality: if specified, the server checks the versioning, performs the required action and then exit, unless its action is 'ignore'. If the action is 'error', it just checks whether the versions are ok. If the action is 'backup', then a backup of the files is made if the versions are not ok. The parameter --config-version-check-result-file is used to specify a file in which the result of the version check has to be put. If the file contains 'ok', then everything went file. If the file contains 'error', then there was an error. If the file contains 'backup', then a backup was made. The installer makes use of this functionality.
+ Admin UI: the selected log entries can now be copied to the clipboard, in CSV, HTML and plaintext formats through the context menu
+ Admin UI: the settings dialog layout has been changed to accomodate for future other protocol settings, factoring out the settings that are common to all protocols.
+ Admin UI: adjusted borders and spacing to look better on HiDPI displays.
+ Admin UI: preserve the fingerprints of the previously connected servers. The connection dialog gives hints when inputing the host and port.
+ Log files can optionally be rotated daily instead of by size
+ Added option to specify a default user to impersonate if a user logs in with an account that does not use impersonation
- MSW: The installer not detects and rejects 32bit Windows
- MSW, Admin UI: No more double error message when a validation error occurs
- Admin UI: Solved a crash and fixed other bugs related to minimzing the main window to the notification area

- Server: the log contains more detailed info about which configuration files have been saved
- Admin UI: the controller used for editing numbers now correctly accepts negative integers

1.3.0-rc1 (2022-02-03)

! The internal tool filezilla-server-crypt now accepts the password from stdin, not anymore as a parameter, to avoid password leaking.
! Mountpoints are now impossible to rename or delete.
+ The configuration files can now be reloaded without shutting down the service first. To make it work, send the SIGHUP signal to the service process on nix, send the paramchange control message to the service on Windows (i.e. 'sc control filezilla-server paramchange').
+ The UI now automatically attempts to reconnect to the server if the connection is lost
+ MSW: users are now case-insensitive
+ Mac: created an installer
+ Display the administration TLS certificate fingerprints at installation time, so that they can be taken note of.
